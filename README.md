### Behavior Driven Development for Ping-Pong:

- Take the users input and display it as a string.

    --input: 12 --output: 1,2,3,4,5,6,...,11,12

- Take the users input and recognize it as a true number, otherwise alert user.

    --input: hello my name is Dan. --output: Alert: "Please enter in an actual number"

- If the string is divisible by 3, return "ping"

    --input: 9 --output: "ping"

- If the string is divisible by 5, return "pong"

    --input: 95 --output: "pong"

- If the number is divisible by 15, return "ping-pong"

    --input: 60 --output: "ping-pong"

- If the number isn't any of the previous 3 points, return as normal

    --input: 2  --output: 1,2

- Returned a compiled string of the previous 4 points

    --input: 12  --output: 1 ,2 ,"ping" ,4 ,"pong" ,"ping" ,7 ,8 ,"ping" ,"pong" ,11 , "ping"

- Have a refresh button so the user may quickly re-enter a different number

    --input: "push button"  --output: refreshes page and empties results

### Known Bugs
